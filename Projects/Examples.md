# Introduction Examples
**Exercise 1:**

Create a function called `overUnder()` that randomly generates a number between 0-100, the user will then guess if the next number will be over or under the next number.  It must also loop around. An example prompt might be:<br />
`The Number is 57. Will the next number be over or under?`<br />
`> Over`<br />
`Sorry the number was 2. Would you like to play again`<br />
`> Yes`<br />
`The Number is 34. Will the next number be over or under?`<br />
`> Over`<br />
`Congrats the number was 34 you won! Would you like to play again`<br />
`> No`<br /><br />

**Exercise 2:**

Create a math question generator that runs infinitly. Create a function `mathGame()` That randomly generates 2 numbers between 0 and 10 and randomly selects an operation * + - (division excluded because math hard). Then, the user types their answer. The game then will check if it is correct, display the result. It then will ask a new question. The game will end if the user answers with `404`

**Exercise 3:**

Create a function called `changeMaker()` that will allow the user to input the change owed to the user. The code will then figure out the proper bills and coinage for the user, using $20, $10, $5, $1, quarters, nickels, dimes, and pennies. It will then give the change.
