# Introduction Examples
**Exercise 1:**

Create a function called `overUnder()` that randomly generates a number between 1-100, the user will then guess if the next number will be over or under the next number.  It must also loop around. An example prompt might be:<br />
`The Number is 57. Will the next number be over or under?`
`> Over`
`Sorry the number was 2. Would you like to play again`
`> Yes`
`The Number is 34. Will the next number be over or under?`
`> Over`
`Congrats the number was 34 you won! Would you like to play again`
`> No`
