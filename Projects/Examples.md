# Introduction Examples
**Exercise 1:**

Create a function called `overUnder()` that randomly generates a number between 1-100, the user will then guess if the next number will be over or under the next number.  It must also loop around. An example prompt might be:<br />
`The Number is 57. Will the next number be over or under?`<br />
`> Over`<br />
`Sorry the number was 2. Would you like to play again`<br />
`> Yes`<br />
`The Number is 34. Will the next number be over or under?`<br />
`> Over`<br />
`Congrats the number was 34 you won! Would you like to play again`<br />
`> No`<br /><br />
