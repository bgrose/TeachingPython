# Introduction Examples
**Exercise 1:**
Create a function called `exercise1()` that prints "Hell World" <br /><br />
**Exercise 2:**
Write a function called `exercise2(x,y)` that prints the sum and product of the numbers x and y on separate lines, the sum printing first.<br /><br />
**Exercise 3:**
Write a function called `exercise3(n)` that adds up the numbers 1 through n and prints out the result. You should use either a while loop or a for loop.<br /><br />
**Exercise 4:**
Write a function called `exercise4(miles)` that converts miles to feet. There are 5280 feet in each mile. Make the program print out the following statement: "There are 10560 feet in 2 miles."<br /><br />
**Exercise 5:**
Write a function called `exercise5(age)`. This function should use if-elif-else statement to print out "Have a glass of milk." for anyone under 7; "Have a coke." for anyone under 21, and "Have some Sangria." for anyone 21 or older.<br /><br />
**Exercise 6:**
Write a function called `exercise6()` that computes the area of a trapezoid. Here is the formula: `A = (1/2)(b1+b2)h`. In the formula b1 is the length of one of the bases, b2 the other. The height is h and the area is A. Use input statements to ask for the bases and the height. Convert these input strings to real numbers using `float()`.<br /><br />
**Exercise 7:**
Write a function `exercise7()` that takes a list called `my_list` and does all of the following, each on a separate line. Recall that lists start numbering with an index of 0.

-   print the whole list
-   print the item with index 0
-   print the last item in the list
-   print the items with indexes 3 through 5 but not including 5
-   print the items up to the one with index 3 but not including item 3
-   print the items starting at index 3 and going through the end.
-   print the length of the list (use  `len()`)
-   Use the  `append()`  method of a list to append the letter  `z`  onto a list and print the list with  `z`  appended.

Use my_list = ['Keanu', 'River', 'Leonardo', 'Brad', 'A', '1998']<br /><br />

**Exericse 8:**
Write a function called `exercise8(csv_file, element)` that will read in the CSV file `periodictable.csv` to a dictionary and then looks up and prints out the atomic number and symbol for calcium. Don't forget to import the csv library and make sure the program works whether or not the element string is capitalized or not. The dictionary key should be element and the values should be the atomic number and symbol.<br />
